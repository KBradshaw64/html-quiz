# html-quiz

## Description

This project is my first attempt at creating an interactive webpage in the form of a quiz. I would like to include a way to store high-scores, change the page layout by clicking on visible buttons, and rotate through questions with varying order each instance quiz is run. This first attempt has shown me how complex a simple idea can be to try and implement.

## Usage

This short quiz can be used to brush up on a few tidbits of coding information in addition to exploring the functionality of JavaScript/HTML when using the web inspection tool.

## Credits

In order to put together the small amount of functional code I have here I frequently visited sites like stackoverflow, w3schools, and MDN webdocs. I also used my ASU class-repository for examples of similar functions, as well as asked my tutor Sam Beals and fellow classmate Adam Johnson. No code was explicitly copy/pasted.
