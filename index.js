// there need to be variables to show answers right/wrong as well as a highscore table to track the most answered correctly in a run
// there needs to be a 30 second timer that starts when a new question appears on screen
// if the timer runs out then the question is marked wrong and automatically goes to next question
// there should be a start button to initiate the quiz, and each multiple choice has a button that is either "wrong" or "correct"


// maybe make each question a variable with set attributes like the correct answer in order for function to check
// var question1 = {
    question: "bsdssfdjgznkj"
    answer: "awshbsldg"
    wrong1: "awd"
    
// }
// then have a function that calls for question1.question and an if statement that says is event.target = question1.answer then print "correct!" etc
